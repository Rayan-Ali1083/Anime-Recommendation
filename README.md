# Anime Recommendation System

## Overview

This is an Anime Recommendation System that utilizes a combination of User-Based Collaborative Filtering, Content Filtering, and Deep Neural Networks (DNN) to provide personalized anime recommendations. This system aims to enhance the user experience by offering suggestions based on user preferences, viewing history, and content features.

## Features

- **User-Based Collaborative Filtering:** Recommends anime based on the preferences and behavior of similar users. This collaborative approach helps users discover new anime that align with their tastes.

- **Content Filtering:** Takes into account the content features of anime, such as genre, theme, and style, to recommend shows that are similar in terms of content. This helps in diversifying recommendations and suggesting anime with similar thematic elements.

- **Deep Neural Networks (DNN):** Utilizes deep learning models to capture complex patterns and relationships in user behavior and anime features. The DNN component enhances the system's ability to understand and recommend anime based on intricate characteristics.
